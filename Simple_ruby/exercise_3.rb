# Write a Ruby program that takes two numbers as user input,
# calculates their sum, and prints the result.

#print 'input a number'
#a = gets.chomp.to_i
#print 'input a number'
#b = gets.chomp.to_i

#sum = a + b

#puts "The sum of a and b is #{sum}"

puts 'a = 10'
a = 10
puts 'b = 10'
b = 10

sum = a + b

puts "the sum of a and b is #{sum}"
