#Write a Ruby program that takes a person's birth year as a variable, calculates their age, and then prints a message with their birth year and current age.
# Have a variable for the birth year.
# Calculate the person's age (assuming the current year is 2024).
# Print a message that includes both the birth year and the calculated age
